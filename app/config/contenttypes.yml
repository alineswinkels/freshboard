# This file defines the contenttypes on the website. See the documentation for
# details: http://docs.bolt.cm/content#defining-contenttypes

# Pages can be used for the more 'static' pages on your site. Things like
# 'about us', 'contact' or a 'disclaimer'. This content-type has a 'templateselect'
# field, which allows you to override the record_template setting for an
# individual page.
# The taxonomy for this contenttype is defined as 'chapters', which is a so-called
# "grouping taxonomy". This way you can easily group sets of pages that logically
# belong together. If your site has a 'services' section, in which you'd like to
# list the different types of services a company provides, you can group these
# together.

# Entries can be used for things like 'news' or 'blogpostings'. They have a 'teaser',
# which can be used for a short blurb on listing-pages, allowing visitors to
# click-through to the rest of the entry. It also has fields for an image and an
# optional video.
# A relation is defined to the pages contenttype. This way you can refer to a page
# from your news-item.
# This contenttype defines 'categories' and 'tags' as taxonomies, allowing the
# editor to use both to categorize a specific entry.
# The 'sort' is set to '-datepublish', which means that newer entries will be
# shown above older entries.

# Using YAML repeated nodes
#
# YAML allows the defining of "repeated nodes". These allow you to define a 'node'
# with a 'key: &name' and referenced later with '<<: *name'
#
# Bolt allows you to define this with the special entry of '__nodes:' that itself
# won't create a Contenttype, but will allow you to use it in actual contenttypes
# to prevent repeating yourself.
#
# To achieve this, first create a key '__nodes:'
#__nodes:
#    field_defaults: &field_defaults
#        title:
#            type: text
#            class: large
#            group: main
#        slug:
#            type: slug
#            uses: title
#    template_defaults: &template_defaults
#        template:
#            type: templateselect
#            filter: '*.twig'
#            group: meta
#
# Then, as an example, you could create a Contenttype with default fields, with
# an additional 'image' field.
#
#contenttype_abc:
#    name: Contenttype Abc
#    fields:
#        <<: *field_defaults
#        image:
#            type: image
#            attrib: title
#            extensions: [ gif, jpg, png ]
#        <<: *template_defaults
#    taxonomy: [ chapters ]
#    recordsperpage: 10
#
# Alternatively, or additionally, you then can thencreate a Contenttype with
# default fields, and a 'select' field, and a different 'templateselect' option.
#
#contenttype_xyz:
#    name: Contenttype Xyz
#    fields:
#        <<: *field_defaults
#        selectfield:
#            type: select
#            values: [ none, foo, bar ]
#        template:
#            type: templateselect
#            filter: '*_xyz.twig'
#    taxonomy: [ tags ]
#    recordsperpage: 20

# Possible field types:
#
